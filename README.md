# Heart failure prediction using Machine Learning.
# Dataset description
  The dataset was collected from secondary data source in Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/heart-failure-clinical-data. It contains the medical records of 299 heart failure patients. No missing entries were found
The dataset  contains a total of 13 features, including a time variable (follow-up period, 130 days on average), and the response variable (death event). The target variable is whether a patient will survive or not. 

  This study aims to develop prediction models for patient survival in heart failure conditions. The heart failure dataset collected from secondary data source in Kaggle, which contains relevant medical information about 299 heart failure patients. We applied several machine learning classifiers to predict patient survival based on heart failure-related pathophysiological parameters. Using the correlation matrix, we analysed the features corresponding to the most crucial risk factors.
  
  Our prediction models used the following machine learning techniques: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and KNN, and achieved improved results. Our analysis indicates that logistics regression achieved the highest accuracy of 88.89% in predicting the survival of heart failure patients compared to other machine learning algorithms.
